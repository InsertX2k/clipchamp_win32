# Clipchamp Video Editor
A simple clone of the Microsoft Clipchamp application (can be found on Microsoft Store, comes preinstalled with Windows 11) built on top of Chromium engine instead of Edge Webview engine.

## Features
* Built on top of the Chromium engine, which is faster and even more lightweight on resources than the Edge Webview engine
* For Windows releases it isn't a Microsoft Store app, it is a Win32 App (which means it will be available for Windows versions older than Windows 10)
* Written in Python 3, using cefpython library
* Runs on all the platforms supported by chromium and the cefpython library (Which means that it supports Windows, Linux, and MacOS too!, all using the same code)
* Written using the Tkinter framework, which gives you a lightweight feeling and consumes the least amount of resources possible, this makes it run like a breeze on old computers!)
* Enables you to use Microsoft Clipchamp without signing in to a Microsoft account (I don't know if that was supported on the main app, haven't tested that)
* More solid/stable navigation and the ability to use Dev Tools!

... And all the other features Clipchamp has to offer you.
